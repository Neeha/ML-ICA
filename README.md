# ML-ICA
Independent Component Analysis

Using ICA to solve the blind Source problem (also referred to as the cocktail party problem) which involves the separation of a
set of source signals from mixed signals, without any information about the source signals or the mixing process. The sound signals are non-guassian (if the input sources are guassian in nature, they would be rotationally symmetric and it is not possible to distinguish them using ICA i.e. we assume the input vector is not multi variate Guassian).
